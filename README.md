# Simple Games 2.0

This is the reforged version of Simple Games (which was abandoned...).

This program is made with C++, while using similar libraries from last one, as well as some codes and ideas from the previous repo.

__Notice:__ this program uses `<windows.h>` and `<conio.h>` that are not standard C++ libraries. Currently I'm only interested in finishing this one on windows and I may try to port that to linux (no idea how to do that now...)

__Plan of this program:__ Should include a starting scene, which can be controlled by WSAD + Space/Enter + Esc, to select game and difficulty, then start games, record score, ...
