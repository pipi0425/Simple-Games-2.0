# Terminal Games 2.0

## Update 2020/01/20
Currently don't have time to work on this... Maybe this is another abandoned project... Or maybe I will come back a few months later...

## General Info
This is the reforged version of Simple Games (which was abandoned...).

This program is made with C++, while using similar libraries from last one, as well as some codes and ideas from the previous repo.

__Notice:__ this program uses `<windows.h>` and `<conio.h>` that are not standard C++ libraries. Currently I'm only interested in finishing this one on windows and I may try to port that to linux (no idea how to do that now...)

## Todo List:
- [x] Starting scene  `2019-06-10`
- [ ] Use timer library
- [ ] Implement Snake
- [ ] Implement Race
- [ ] Implement 2048
- [ ] Implement Tree
- [ ] (maybe) Record score and compare
- [ ] (maybe) Add cheat (command) mode
- [ ] (maybe) Implement Tower of Hanoi
- [ ] (maybe) Add colour
